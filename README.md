# Evira interview example

This is a barebones code base for the Evira home interview. You should have received the interview instructions in a separate email. You will only receive this codebase if you have indicated that you have experience of React or in unique cases javascript.

## Dependencies

You are encouraged to use the installed dependencies but you are allowed to install any other dependencies you need.

## Running the app

The example is based on create-react-app and requires node. We recommend installing node version manager if you don't already have node installed. If you use nvm, run `nvm use` to load the node version from the nvmrc file.

You can start the page by running the following command: `yarn install && yarn start`. It should automatically launch in your web-browser but if it doesn't, you can open the page as instructed in the terminal.

## Learn More

If you want to learn more about react we recommend the official docs: [https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).

## ESLint

We recommend that you take a look at the terminal output or install an ESLint plugin to your preferred IDE.
